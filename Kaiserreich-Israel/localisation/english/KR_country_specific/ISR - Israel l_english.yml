  ISR_david_ben_gurion_desc: "David Ben-Gurion, born David Grün in Congress Poland, immigrated to the Vilayet of Jerusalem in Ottoman Palestine in 1905 during the peroid of the second Yishuv. After a long and successful career in representing Jewish workers unions and political groups to the local Ottoman authorities, he has risen to become the preeminent leader of both Labor Zionism and the Yishuv itself. After the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the levant, and the potential for Arab Nationalist violence to take it's place, Ben-Gurion has decided to act now. Both to save the Yishuv from potential violence or destruction from fanatical neighbors, and to make into reality the Zionist dream of Jewish independence."

### Events ###
  
  ISR.999.t: "What's in a name?"
  ISR.999.d: "With indepence secured and a permanent government established, one odd issue is the name, while pretty much everyone is fine with Israel,the fact is for the longest time, the region was know as Palestine, a name derived from Syria Palaestina, a name given by the Romans after the Roman-Jewish, meant to dejudaize the province. While it is obvious such a name now was no place in a reborn Jewish state, if we where to keep in using it, it would please some of the more Roman minded Westerners.
  ISR.999.a: "The name belongs in a museum."
  ISR.999.b: "How often do you think of the Roman Empire?"
