  ISR_david_ben_gurion_desc: "David Ben-Gurion, born David Grün in Congress Poland, immigrated to the Vilayet of Jerusalem in Ottoman Palestine in 1905 during the peroid of the second Yishuv. After a long and successful career in representing Jewish workers unions and political groups to the local Ottoman authorities, he has risen to become the preeminent leader of both Labor Zionism and the Yishuv itself. After the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the levant, and the potential for Arab Nationalist violence to take it's place, Ben-Gurion has decided to act now. Both to save the Yishuv from potential violence or destruction from fanatical neighbors, and to make into reality the Zionist dream of Jewish independence."

  ISR.999.t: "What's in a name?"
  ISR.999.d: "With indepence secured and a permanent government established, one odd issue is the name, while pretty much everyone is fine with Israel,the fact is for the longest time, the region was know as Palestine, a name derived from Syria Palaestina, a name given by the Romans after the Roman-Jewish War, meant to dejudaize the province. While it is obvious such a name now was no place in a reborn Jewish state, if we where to keep in using the old name, it would please some of the more Roman minded Westerners."
  ISR.999.a: "The name belongs in a museum."
  ISR.999.b: "How often do you think of the Roman Empire?"

  ISR_hess_vision_desc: "Moses Hess wrote Rome and Jerusalem in 1862, and while his perdiction of an ultranationialist Germany being the end of Jews in Europe clearly has turned out wrong, the fact is not only has the Ottomen Empire fell but Israel is standing stand by side with the Arab states.

  ISR_haams_dream_desc: "Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg, better known as Ahad Ha'am, pioneered Culteral Zionism in oppostion to Herzl's Political Zionism. He wasn't exactly wrong, while having our own state is nice and all, it would mean nothing at the end of the day if they is no cultural. Let's work to ensure that we are not a State of Jews, but a really Jewish State."

  ISR_bund_reconcile: "Reconcile with the Bund"
  ISR_bund_reconcile: "While the General Jewish Labour Bund has histocally been opposite to Zionism, the fact is, this opposition has more to do with the fact that every Jew that made Aliyah was one less Jew that would have support them. But why should we let that get in the way of what would be a fruitful partnership? After all, didn't the great Zionist thinkers talked about a thriving Jewish homeland along side a thriving Jewish diaspora? Our new foregin office shall new assest the Bund to help achieve this vision."

  ISR_old_scores_to_settle_desc: "The General Jewish Labour Bund has time and again opposed us, all for a pity reason too. Now that we are a state of our own, we can use the foreign office to undermind the Bund."
