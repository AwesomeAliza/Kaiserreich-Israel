This is an submod for the Kaiserreich alternate universe in the game Hearts of Iron 4, that adds Israel as a nation. 
This nation is playable either after a revolt from National Populist Syria/collapsing Ottoman Empire (in some paths), or as a releaseable tag after taking Jerusalem in a peace deal, in typical Kaiserreich fashion.
